Picky documentation
===================

Picky is a tool for making sure that the packages you have installed
with `pip`__ or `conda`__ match those you have specified.

__ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

__ http://conda.pydata.org/docs/

It has been split into two tools:

* `picky-pip`__ for virtualenvs and other environments where pip is used to
   manage packages
* `picky-conda`__ for conda environments.
