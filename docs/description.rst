Picky is a tool for making sure that the packages you have installed
with `pip`__ or `conda`__ match those you have specified.

It has been split into two packages:

* `picky-pip`__ for virtualenvs and other environments where pip is used to
   manage packages
* `picky-conda`__ for conda environments.
